# Submission Guidelines

It's official! Marcy Lab now has it's own [Medium publication](https://medium.com/the-marcy-lab-school)! You all have been putting out some really great content and I thought it might help to show that it's all coming from on place, Marcy Lab!

# Why are we making this?
In short? To make you look good. When you share your article on your linkedin, it will look more impressive to people that your article is appearing on a publication and it has 431 claps, vs a Dev article with 13 unicorns.

## That seems like a lot of claps
That's right! And the way we're going to get there is by apploading the heck out of each other. Support each other dangit! There are about 6 of you writing regularly, plus Maya, Reuben, and I. You do the math and that's an hefty audience for every single piece.

However, that's just to get this jumpstarted. If we're consistent with our quality content, it won't be long before our organic reach starts spreading. It really just depends on the article hitting a trend. But to start, we'll support each other and make sure that everyone looks good, no matter what.

# Plan of Action

## 1. Create a Medium Account
To get started, you have to actually be on Medium of course. Whether or not you sign up for the paywall is totally up to you, check down in the FAQ for more info.

## 2. Send me your Medium account
I will then take your username and add it to the publication. This will let you actually submit drafts and published pieces to me.

## 3. Repost your *two* favorite articles
I believe you all have been focusing on dev.to so just add in the two best/highest rated articles you've written so far. Feel free to edit them how you see fit, and use whatever you want for the code snippets. I use the in-built Medium code snippets and then bold things myself, but [GitHub gists](https://medium.com/@achilleus/add-code-to-your-medium-article-github-gist-77b0c1815c12) are also super.

Once they are written, don't publish it immediately, but rather add it to the Marcy Lab publication. Here is how to [add a piece to a publication](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/213904978-Add-a-draft-or-post-to-publication).

## 4. Publish and clap them
I have found the best results sun-wed at like 7am. Once they are published, I'll link them in Slack, and then it will be your job to just clap the hell out of them. Once they have sufficienct attention, please do share it on your linkedin or anywhere you like.

## 5. Continue to publish
From here on out, just publish both on Medium and Dev, and ping me when you're done with Medium so I can catch it and schedule it for an early morning publish the next day, or the next closest high traffic time. If you send me an article on friday nght for instance, I'm gonna hold off until a monday morning publish.

# What does a publication do?
It's not like we can suddenly get you a billion views on your articles, but we do have some nifty things to use. By being published your article is automatically ranked a tad higher in search. There's also the cross-polination effect of having a nice looking front page that can be curated (Users can't really feature more than one article at a time but publications can). There's going to be a weekly newsletter I put together, however while people aren't signed up for it yet, that won't be very powerful at the start

## What should *you* do?
Once your articles have been published and have all of your team members' claps, then you should share it on Linkedin, ideally around 8am EST to catch the pre-work crowd just checking their feeds (it used to be commuters, but that's somewhat diminished what with the end of the world and all). If you have any other social media feel free to share it there, however a word of caution on that.

These articles are an extension of your professional profile, so if you share it on your twitter for example _**make sure that your profile is ready to be related to your job search**_.

# FAQ
## Should I use the paywall?
This is honestly up to you, it does block your content but in a weird way that actually makes it *more* accessible on Medium. See, if you don't put your content behind the wall, Medium will essentially ignore it. It will not be available for curation, and will not be recommended to readers.

If you do put it behind the paywall, it's quite likely that your work will get curated in `programming`, `javascript` or [one of the many other topics](https://medium.com/topics). You may even earn a little bit of money for your efforts.

## Can I still post on Dev?
Yes! In fact if you feel weird about putting your work behind a paywall, you can repost it on Dev for free! Just be sure on Dev to add your Medium version as the [canonical_url](https://dev.to/laurieontech/a-primer-on-seo-49n1)

## What if I find another publisher?
Good! One of the main ideas is that we are the fallback to make sure you always look solid. The first few pieces each of you make are going to be direct submissions, this will help establish the publication and frankly, help me keep track of things. However, after a few pieces under your belt, we'll start submitting your pieces without a publisher, and waiting a few days.

If no one reaches out, we'll bring it back under the publication so it looks official. But I'm willing to bet that soon some of the heavy hitters will reach out to you about publishing, and then you're in baby. This may be a short lived project once all of you get publishers, but again, the goal is to make you guys look good on linkedin, not get a million views for this publication.

## Can teachers submit?
Yes to you teachers as well! *Especially* if the piece is about Marcy Lab or something related. My plan for teacher articles is that they might also help bring in traffic, I know I have a few articles that still manage to get a hundred views or so a week, so that might bring eyeballs in to the students' content.

# Tips for Technical Writing

## Must haves
Each article written must contain:
- A title
- A sub-heading
- A cover image
- All five tags

Your profile must also have a proper name, bio, and anything but the default photo (the nicer the better, headshots are best, but I don't use that and I'm fine). And by proper name I mean like "The Coder Dude" and not "coderdude712@gmail." The name should look like an intentional choice. The reason for this is becuase Medium will only curate articles that have complete looking profiles. Basically, don't look like a bot.

## Ideal Length
3-7 minutes is the ideal length for Medium. And to start out, I would say that's a pretty good metric. Any longer and you could probably stand to edit it down, any shorter and you should ask yourself if this topic really deserves its own article. Medium released some [interesting data on ideal length](https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b)

## Break it up
Think of your readers like swimmers, and pure text as the sea. If you have nothing but text, they're going to drown. So throw out some rafts for them to hold on to. Headings, sub headings, bullet points, pictures, and of course code, are all wonderfull things to break up the monotony. Paragraphs should be short, and typically no more than 2 of them before a heading or some other visual cue.

## Code is King
This is purely subjective, but I have found that tutorials *always* do better than book reports. If I had an article about the history of browser cookies and an article about how to implement cookies in Express, the latter would do way better. This is just something to keep in mind in the future if you want to boost your views.

## Know your audience
Are you writing for people just learning about the technology, or those who are well versed in it already. For instance, if you're writing about render props in react, if you were writing for well versed React devs, you don't need to waste any virtual ink on explaining to them what props themselves are.

It's just important to know this becuase it will help focus your writing, and make it easier to know what to cut after the first draft.


## Don't be bummed if you don't get views
It is *super* dependent on luck. I literally had a piece get 20,000 views in one week, then my next piece barely crack like 67 views. It is wildly inconsistent, but the more you write, the more likely something will get picked up. Also, Followers are nice to have, but do very little. I have 850 right now and it seems to have virtually no effect.

Your primary goal at this stage is just to write pieces and hone your communication skills. Don't be too down on yourself if one piece doesn't do as well as your others. No stress, this should be fun!
