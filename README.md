Guidelines for good submissions

It's official! Marcy Lab now has it's own [Medium publication](https://medium.com/the-marcy-lab-school)! You all have been putting out some really great contact

# Why are we making this?
In short? To make you look good. When you share your article on your linkedin, it will look more impressive to people that your article is appearing on a publication and it has 431 claps, vs a Dev article with 13 unicorns.

## That seems like a lot of claps
That's right! And the way we're going to get there is by each apploading the heck out of each other. Support each other dangit! There are about 6 of you writing regularly, plus Maya, Reuben, and I. You do the math and that's an inbuilt audience for every single piece.

However, that's just to get this jumpstarted. If we're consistent with our quality content, it won't be long before our organic reach starts spreading. and you might get some articles close to the 1,000 range. It really just depends on the article hitting a trend. But to start, we'll support each other and make sure that everyone looks good, no matter what. 

## 1. Create a Medium Account
To get started, you have to actually be on Medium of course. Wheth


# What tools do we have at our disposal?
It's not like we can suddenly get you a billion views on your articles, but we do have some nifty things to use. By being published your article is automatically ranked a tad higher in search. There's also the cross-polination effect of having a nice looking front page that can be curated (Users can't really feature more than one article at a time but publications can). There's also going to be a weekly newsletter I put together each week, however while people aren't signed up for it yet, that won't be very powerful at the start

## What should you do?
Once your articles have been published and have all of your team members claps, then you should share it on Linkedin, ideally around 8am EST to catch the pre-work crowd just checking their feeds (it used to be commuters, but that's somewhat diminished what with the end of the world and all). If you have any other social media feel free to share it there, however a word of caution on that. 

These articles are an extension of your professional profile, so if you share it on your twitter for example _**make sure that your profile is ready to be related to your job search**_. 

# FAQ
## Should I use the paywall?
This is honestly up to you, it does block your content but in a weird way that actually makes it *more* accessible on Medium. See, if you don't put your content behind the wall, Medium will essentially ignore it. It will not be available for curation, and will not be recommended to readers.

If you do put it behind the paywall, it's quite likely that your work will get curated in `programming`, `javascript` or [one of the many other topics](https://medium.com/topics). You may even earn a little bit of money for your efforts.

## Can I still post on Dev?
Yes! In fact if you feel weird about putting your work behind a paywall, you can repost it on Dev for free! Just be sure on Dev to add your Medium version as the [canonical_url](https://dev.to/laurieontech/a-primer-on-seo-49n1)

## What if I find another publisher?
Good! One of the main ideas is that we are the fallback to make sure you always look solid. The first few pieces each of you make are going to be direct submissions, this will help establish the publication and frankly, help me keep track of things. However, after a few pieces under your belt, we'll start submitting your pieces without a publisher, and waiting a few days.

If no one reaches out, we'll bring it back under the publication so it looks official. But I'm willing to bet that soon some of the heavy hitters will reach out to you about publishing, and then you're in baby. But frankly, some pieces are
